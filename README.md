# Procedural-Object-Placer
Procedural Object Placer and Level Generator is a Unity tool created with the intention of rapidly placing mesh models on various terrains to create random levels. The tool is split into two primary parts: an object placer and a random line generator.

The tool was built to create levels for a game where the user follows a path through a predefinend and populated level. Example below.

*This tool can also quickly place a large amount of objects following patterns defined by unity colliders.
